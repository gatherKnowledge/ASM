```
****************  # How to use? # ***************************************
There are 2 tools in DevTools. You can install them.

The file compile.bat is the switch that can be used easily.

You can operate them like this;
    > compile.bat boot1_2
    >
If you need to optimize the batch file, you should do that. good luck!
